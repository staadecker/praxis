# bin_labelling_research

A web app that tests different garbage bin labels.

Visit [the webpage](https://staadecker.github.io/praxis/).

## Notes for myself:

How to copy data from firebase:

gsutil -m cp -r gs://praxis-i-research.appspot.com "C:\Users\machs\Documents\praxis_data"

In `res/myhal_bin.svg` the coffee and containers ids are switched. This means that data is flipped.
It is corrected in the analysis.
